# Lab 01 Report

In this lab, I learned how to set up my development environment using VS Code and Git.
I practiced creating repositories, adding files, committing changes, and pushing them to GitHub.
I also learned how branches work and how merging combines different versions of a project.
This lab improved my understanding of version control and collaborative development.
Now I feel confident managing projects using Git and GitHub.
